Pitch (also called F0 or fundamental frequency) is a very important voice feature for smart mobility features, such as driverâ€™s emotion detection, vehicle personalized profiles, and secured speaker identification. This Python code built a novel approach to detect F0 through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and image processing techniques to directly estimate pitch from spectrogram images.
